          <h2>Full Stack Developer</h2>
          <p>
            I love to write code and I love to learn! I have experience in a
            number of technologies and frameworks including: Javascript, React,
            MongoDB, FireBase, Jest etc. Having completed a six month internship
            with a SAAS provider I have gained hands on experience working as
            part of a development team using Git / Bitbucket and Jira. I am
            currently looking for a junior development role. I hope you enjoy
            browsing my site where you can find my coding story, my CV and my
            E-Commerce Project using React and Firebase amongst other
            technologies.

          <p>
            Welcome to my Full Stack Web Development Portfolio! My journey into
            the world of coding began around 5 years ago when I started creating
            automated trading algorithms in C / C++. As I delved deeper into the
            world of programming, I fell in love with it and decided to pursue
            it as a future career. I am always keen to learn the fundamentals of
            anything I do and so enroled on Harvard's CS50X course to gain a
            deeper understanding of the fundamental concepts of computer science
            and software engineering. I gained experience working with a wide
            range of technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and
            SQL. After completing CS50, I felt ready to gain some industry
            experience, so I decided to take on a 6-month internship with a SAAS
            provider. During my time there, I was part of a team responsible for
            developing and maintaining the company's web applications. This
            experience allowed me to work on real-world projects, collaborating
            with other developers and gaining valuable insights into the
            industry. Overall, my journey as a full stack web developer has been
            exciting and rewarding. I am passionate about coding and am
            constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to learn and
            grow. If you're looking for a dedicated, motivated, and skilled full
            stack web developer, please don't hesitate to contact me. I look
            forward to working with you!

            This is a small app which allows a user to register a simulated share account and buy and sell shares quoted at realtime prices.
            The app continues to check the current share prices when refreshed to show a realtime profit / loss. 
            The shares can then be sold at the current price to realise the gain or loss.
