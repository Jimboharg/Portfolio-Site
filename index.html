          <p>
            I love to write code and I love to learn! <br>I have experience in a
            number of technologies and frameworks including: Javascript, React, Jest, Python, HTML, CSS, Firestore/Firebase MongoDB, GraphQL and SQLite amongst others. 
            <br>Having completed a six month internship
            with a SAAS provider I have gained hands on experience working as
            part of a development team using Git / Bitbucket and Jira. 
            <br>I am currently looking for a junior development role and hope you enjoy
            browsing my site where you can find my coding story, CV and

          <p>
            Welcome to my portfolio site! My journey into
            the world of coding began around 5 years ago when I started creating
            automated trading algorithms in C / C++ alongside working as a partner in a 
            small ecommerce business.<br>
            As I delved deeper into the world of programming, I fell in love with it 
            and decided to seriously pursue it as a career. <br>
            I always like to learn the fundamentals of
            anything I do and so enroled on Harvard University's famously challenging 
            CS50X course to gain a deeper understanding of the essential concepts of computer science
            and software engineering. 
            <br>I gained knowledge working with a wide
            range of technologies, including C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and
            SQL. The course also taught the fundamentals of programming from basic 
            loops through to complex data structures such as linked lists and hash tables.
            <br>After proudly completing CS50 with a 100% pass score, I felt ready to gain some industry
            experience. <br>I decided to approach a family member who is a CTO of a SAAS startup to take on a six-month 
            internship in order to gain some valuable industry knowledge. During this time I gained experience 
            working as part of a development team using technologies such as Git and Bitbucket as well as 
            gaining exposure to a large production codebase. The majority of this time was concentrated on refactoring 
            the code and writing integration tests as well as updating the company's API documentation. <br>
            I am passionate about coding and am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to learn and
            grow. I am now looking for a position as a junior developer and am excited to make development my long term career.
